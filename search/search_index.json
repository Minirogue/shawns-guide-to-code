Take the following data class definition for example:</p> <p><pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val surname: String,\n    val middleName: String?,\n)\n</code></pre> The comma after <code>val middleName: String?</code> is the trailing comma. The comma isn't strictly necessary because there is no argument after <code>middleName</code>, but it is still considered syntactically correct.  Trailing commas were introduced in Kotlin 1.4.</p> <p>Trailing can sometimes seem as contentious and potentially trivial as the Oxford comma, which makes them a great candidate for bike-shedding. Indeed, once I started adding more trailing commas in a codebase that didn't have an enforced decision about whether to use them, I would often get \"was this intentional?\" comments in my code reviews. At the other end, how useful is \"a trailing comma might have prevented this\" as a comment on a one-line commit fixing a merge issue? At the end of the day, the choice to use or not use trailing commas isn't going to make or break your codebase, but leaving it up to each developer to make the choice for themselves is likely to burn more developer time than it's worth.</p> <p>So, at minimum, I'd recommend putting forth some kind of official guidance for your codebase/organization encouraging or discouraging the use of trailing commas. That way you can just follow whatever the official guidance is and resolve any code review comments with a link to the codebase/organization's official guidance. I'd go even further by recommending a stronger stance of either mandating or forbidding trailing commas as part of your static code analysis tooling, which should prevent any unnecessary comments in the first place (see Tooling section).</p> <p>For the rest of this post, I will be arguing for why you should mandate trailing commas as opposed to forbidding them. </p>","tags":["Kotlin","Code Style"]},{"location":"trailing-commas/#the-benefits-of-trailing-commas","title":"The Benefits of Trailing Commas","text":"<p>If you've never seen them before, trailing commas can seem like a weird choice.

If we do not initially have a trailing comma on the <code>middleName</code> property, then the diff will look like this:</p> <p><pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val surname: String,\n-   val middleName: String?\n+   val middleName: String?,\n+   val age: Int\n)\n</code></pre> But if we had the trailing comma on <code>middleName</code>, then the diff will have one less removal and one less addition:</p> <p><pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val surname: String,\n    val middleName: String?,\n+   val age: Int,\n)\n</code></pre> There is a slightly higher cognitive load to reading the first diff. At first glance, you might ask \"Why are we removing the middle name?\" but after a moment it is clear that the line changed, and we're just adding a comma. In the second diff, it's immediately clear that all we're doing is adding one new property. It may not be a world-changing improvement, but it's still an improvement.</p> <p>Adding arguments to class constructors, list creations, etc. is very common in almost any codebase. So, while the immediate benefit is small, it adds up over the lifetime of the codebase.</p>","tags":["Kotlin","Code Style"]},{"location":"trailing-commas/#reordering-arguments","title":"Reordering Arguments","text":"<p>A smaller (but perhaps more apparent) benefit of trailing commas is the ease of reordering arguments. For example, if we wanted to move <code>middleName</code> so our <code>Person</code> class reads more in order, we would turn</p> <pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val surname: String,\n    val middleName: String?,\n)\n</code></pre> <p>into</p> <pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val middleName: String?,\n    val surname: String,\n)\n</code></pre> <p>With the trailing comma present, we can easily select the whole line for the <code>middleName</code> property, cut, and paste it in the line above. The result will have all of its commas and will compile cleanly (although you may have an issue with any call-sites that aren't using named arguments).</p> <p>On the other hand, if we want to turn  <pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val surname: String,\n    val middleName: String?\n)\n</code></pre></p> <p>into</p> <pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n    val middleName: String?,\n    val surname: String\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Then cutting and pasting requires us to also move the cursor around to add a comma and remove another comma. It's small, but it's annoying when you know there's an alternative world where you didn't have to do that.</p> <p>Of course, there are also IDE shortcuts for moving lines up/down in JetBrains IDEs (and Android Studio): \u2318\u0421md+Shift+\u2191/\u2193 on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+\u2191/\u2193 on Windows/Linux. Using these commands automatically handles the commas for you and is usually easier than copy/paste as long as you can remember the commands. If you use these commands, then trailing commas aren't better or worse in this case... until we compare the diffs again:</p> <pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n-   val surname: String,\n    val middleName: String?,\n+   val surname: String,\n)\n</code></pre> <p>vs.</p> <pre><code>data class Person(\n    val givenName: String,\n-   val surname: String,\n-   val middleName: String?\n+   val middleName: String?,\n+   val surname: String\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Again, we see a simpler diff in the trailing comma case, where it is clear that just one line moved. Without trailing commas, we get two lines changing simultaneously, and it takes just a second more to comprehend it.

Of course, you may be more careful with your merge conflicts, but that only matters if you're the only one working on this codebase.
