## About This Site

This is the site where I document my opinionated approach to coding best practices, mostly focused on Android and Kotlin.
It's currently a work-in-progress.
You can find the source for this site in [here](https://github.com/Minirogue/shawns-guide-to-code) or by clicking on "GitHub" in the upper corner of any page on this site.
